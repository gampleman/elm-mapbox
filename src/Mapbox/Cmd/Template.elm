module Mapbox.Cmd.Template exposing (Id, Option, Outgoing, Supported, easeTo, fitBounds, flyTo, jumpTo, panBy, panTo, resize, rotateTo, stop, zoomIn, zoomOut, zoomTo)

{-| This module has a bunch of essentially imperative commands for your map.

However, since a published library can't have ports in it, you will need to do some setup. The easiest way to do this is to copy [this file into your app](https://github.com/gampleman/elm-mapbox/blob/master/examples/MapCommands.elm). You can see the module docs for that [here](https://github.com/gampleman/elm-mapbox/blob/master/docs/MapCommands.md).

@docs Id, Outgoing, Option, Supported

You can of course customize the module you copy into your codebase to support things like having multiple maps on the page at once, etc.


### Moving the map around

@docs panBy, panTo, zoomTo, zoomIn, zoomOut, rotateTo, jumpTo, easeTo, flyTo, stop


### Fiting bounds

{-| Returns an array of GeoJSON Feature objects representing visible features that satisfy the query parameters. Takes a numerical ID that allows you to associate the question with the answer.

The response: The properties value of each returned feature object contains the properties of its source feature. For GeoJSON sources, only string and numeric property values are supported (i.e. null, Array, and Object values are not supported).

Each feature includes a top-level layer property whose value is an object representing the style layer to which the feature belongs. Layout and paint properties in this object contain values which are fully evaluated for the given zoom level and feature.

Features from layers whose visibility property is "none", or from layers whose zoom range excludes the current zoom level are not included. Symbol features that have been hidden due to text or icon collision are not included. Features from all other layers are included, including features that may have no visible contribution to the rendered result; for example, because the layer's opacity or color alpha component is set to 0.

The topmost rendered feature appears first in the returned array, and subsequent features are sorted by descending z-order. Features that are rendered multiple times (due to wrapping across the antimeridian at low zoom levels) are returned only once (though subject to the following caveat).

Because features come from tiled vector data or GeoJSON data that is converted to tiles internally, feature geometries may be split or duplicated across tile boundaries and, as a result, features may appear multiple times in query results. For example, suppose there is a highway running through the bounding rectangle of a query. The results of the query will be those parts of the highway that lie within the map tiles covering the bounding rectangle, even if the highway extends into other tiles, and the portion of the highway within each map tile will be returned as a separate feature. Similarly, a point feature near a tile boundary may appear in multiple tiles due to tile buffering.
