# Elm-mapbox code generator

The purpose of this tool is to close the loop with Mapbox Studio and have nice Elm code expressing a Map Style.

It is also an interesting sample of a highly complex JSON Decoder.

Of interest is the Code Generation library MyElm, which will likely be released as a standalone package at some point in the future.
